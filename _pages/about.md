I am Pegah Jandaghi. I am a fifth year PhD student in Computer Science at University of Southern California. 
I am advised by prof [Jay Pujara](https://www.jaypujara.org/), and I am a member of [JAUNTS lab](https://www.jauntslab.org/index.html). 
I work on Dialog Systems, Transfer Learning and Large Language Models.
