I’m Pegah Jandaghi, a final-year PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Southern California. 
I’m advised by Prof. [Morteza Dehghani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=my6AUyAAAAAJ&hl=en). 
I also collaborate closely with [Robin Jia](https://robinjia.github.io/).


My research focuses on Transfer Learning, Dialog Systems, and Large Language Models (LLMs). 
I’m particularly interested in making LLMs more personalized, specialized, and accessible—especially for non-experts.
I’m passionate about advancing techniques that help adapt and evaluate LLMs effectively across domains, enabling broader accessibility and usability for diverse applications.
