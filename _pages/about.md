I’m Pegah Jandaghi, a final-year PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Southern California. 
I’m advised by Prof. [Jay Pujara](https://www.jaypujara.org/) and work as part of the [JAUNTS lab](https://www.jauntslab.org/index.html). 
I also collaborate closely with [Robin Jia](https://robinjia.github.io/).

My research focuses on Transfer Learning, Dialog Systems, and Large Language Models (LLMs). 
I’m particularly interested in making LLMs more personalized, specialized, and accessible—especially for non-experts.
I’m passionate about advancing techniques that help adapt and evaluate LLMs effectively across domains, enabling broader accessibility and usability for diverse applications.
